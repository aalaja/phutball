# Backend/API (Django App)

This directory contains the backend/api. Right now all it does is create games
and log their moves to the database. It is a standardly-structured Django app, plus:
- It also uses `djangorestframework` to simplify the creation of an API and (`django-cors-headers` to allow "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" (CORS) to permit the React app to access the API)
- An extra folder `game_logic` which contains a small fragment of the underlying game logic and
configuration for construction of the data models and serializers.

## Usage

As discussed in the main README, the backend supports running locally in production mode
(containerized) or in dev mode (uncontainerized). (In addition to running online/remotely in production, of course.) The containerized builds are described in the main readme.

To run uncontainerized, you will need to, in order
- Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Install the necessary python packages: psycopg2 (the python interface to postgres) as well as the django packages. Your choice of the following 3:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda env create -f environment.yml 
conda install django djangoresetframework django-cors-headers psycopg2
```

The second will create a new environment, phutball. Run `conda activate phutball` after doing so
The third is only recommended in the case you wish to add the software to an existing environment, and no promises are made about whether it will work.

- Modify the database settings (`DATABASE`) in `./phutball/config/settings/settings_dev` to match
a username and password with access to your postgres database. I find this step to be a bit finnicky.
- Create the database with `python manage.py migrate` (run from this directory) â€“ note the migrations have already been created (see reference below)
- Run the server with `python manage.py runserver`
